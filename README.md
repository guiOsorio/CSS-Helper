# CSS-Helper
This incomplete project was used for my presentation of a business idea in the class ITMG 330 at USD.

The goal of this app is to help developers write code by having an easy-to-use interface which outputs the code required to build their web page prototype, and provides them with a preview of the page, based on their specifications. This app also has the goal of helping beginners to understand CSS better and accelerate their learning process.
